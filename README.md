# Raspberry Pi Pico MIDI Controller
A MIDI Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico and Circuitpython



## How to install:

1.) Click on "Code" above and download this repo as a zip file, then unzip the folder onto your desktop and open it.  
1.) With the Pico disconnected, hold down the "Bootsel" button, then plug it into the computer.  
2.) A folder should open called RPI-RP2 (or something like that) with two files in it.  
3.) Drag the "adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-8.0.5.uf2" file from the unzipped folder into the RPI-RP2 folder.  
4.) The folder should close and the Pico will reboot, then it will open a new folder called "CIRCUITPY".  
5.) Copy everything from the "files" directory in the unzipped folder over to CIRCUITPY.  
6.) After they all transfer successfully, you should be good to go!
