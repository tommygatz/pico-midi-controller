# pico-midi-controller
A MIDI Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico and Circuitpython

## How to install:

1.) With the Pico disconnected, hold down the "Bootsel" button, then plug it into the computer.
2.) A folder should open called RPI-RP2 (or something like that) with two files in it.
3.) Drag the "adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-8.0.5.uf2" file from this folder into the RPI-RP2 folder.
4.) The folder should close and Pico will reboot, then open a new folder called "CIRCUITPY".
5.) Open the folder called "files" in this zip folder, then drag ALL files over to CIRCUITPY.
6.) After they all transfer successfully, you should be good to go!
